	      <p>A quick update from HippyVM to say that project is doing well and what's cool (or rather hot) for us.</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fijall">Maciej Fijałkowski</a> our technical lead, and "know all the things" guy, 
will be talking at <a href="https://www.brnophp.cz/conference-2014">Brno PHP Conference 2014</a>, 
so if you want to know what HippyVM is and how we develop it, grab a ticket. 
A few other people from HippyVM team might be there as well. 
Also please <a href="https://twitter.com/hippyvm">let us know</a> if we should send Maciej elsewhere. </p>
<h2>Project Roadmap</h2>
<p>We're still in our beta phase, and under heavy development.
Our most recent priorities stands for few things:</p>
<p><strong>Well known PHP projects</strong>: Full (or nearly full) functionality for these popular PHP projects, 
which we've put a lot of effort/focus on: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>,
and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.   </p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: We're doing very well here. In some areas we are even a bit ahead of both HHVM and PHP. Still there's lots of room for improvements - and we are on it!</p>
<p><strong>Completeness</strong>: Here HippyVM is still behind PHP, we are missing a few functions/classes here and there. 
Since we are really small team, it'll take a while, but we're working hard to get there!</p>
<h2>Github</h2>
<p>After hearing a lot of calls to move the project to Github as an open source,
we decided to do it. HippyVM is running inside it's own <a href="https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm">organization</a>,
where you'll find all things related to the project and <a href="https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm">HippyVM</a>'s
source.  We've also decided to switch from BuildBot to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/hippyvm/hippyvm">Travis-CI</a>. 
Several extensions will stay proprietary for the time being, including a FastCGI server. 
We're looking into a business models of selling a commercial version of HippyVM</p>
<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>This one is related to all above. Since HippyVM from now on is open-sourced,
and a small team like us needs as much help as we can get, you are more than welcome to join.
Have a look inside our code base, it doesn't look that scary. ;-)
Please visit us on IRC <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hippyvm">#hippyvm@freenode.net</a>,
ask a question, open Github <a href="https://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm/issues">issue</a>,
or just simply send us an email at <a href="mailto:contact@hippyvm.com">contact@hippyvm.com</a>.</p>
<p>Have a productive Monday,<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/sebapawlus">Sebastian Pawluś</a> and HippyVM team. </p>

	      <p>We're pleased to introduce a pre-release of our new implementation
of the <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> language,
HippyVM. This website is dedicated to the ongoing effort of building
a high-performance virtual machine based on the technology built for
a fast Python virtual machine, the <a href="http://pypy.org">PyPy project</a>.</p>
<h2>What's HippyVM?</h2>
<p>HippyVM is a reimplementation of the PHP language using PyPy technology.
It started off as a <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/07/hello-everyone.html">research project done for facebook</a> by Maciej Fijałkowski,
and was later expanded. Right now it contains a fast and reasonably complete
implementation of the core PHP language. It also includes implementations of
many PHP built-in modules, but far from all of them. As of now it does not include
web server integration, so it is not yet suitable for use in production.</p>
<h2>How fast is it?</h2>
<p>We have gathered a set of small benchmarks to test the performance of our virtual
machine. We're in the process of gathering more application-size benchmarks
like mediawiki or wordpress. We'll post them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Current status can be seen in
<a href="http://hippyvm.com/#performance">the performance section</a> of our website, which currently
contains only small-to-medium size microbenchmarks that we
could find or reasonably implement. Right now, HippyVM is <strong>7.3x faster</strong> than stock
PHP and <strong>2x faster</strong> than <a href="http://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a>, using a geometric mean.
Please note that these benchmarks might not be representative, and consult
specific benchmarks as they vary widely.</p>
<h2>Is this Open Source?</h2>
<p><a href="http://github.com/hippyvm/hippyvm">The pre-release</a>
is open source, but we plan to sell a commercial version
in the future. We will have a model where the core language as
well as core JIT technologies remain Open Source, while some extension
modules as well as the web server integration are proprietary.</p>
<p>The pre-release is MIT-licensed.</p>
<h2>What's included and what's not included in the pre-release?</h2>
<p>The pre-release includes only the Open Source part of HippyVM. We will make
a commercial pre-release which includes extension modules and web server
integration some time in the next few months.</p>
<h2>What are the plans for the future?</h2>
<p>We have a good implementation of the PHP language, but we're missing many
crucial modules. We aim to finish this part later this year. We're also
planning to have a novel bridge which would let you leverage the Python ecosystem
from PHP. Additionally, we're investing ongoing effort into making our JIT
technology even better and making both PyPy and Hippy a lot faster.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/fijall">Maciej Fijałkowski</a> and the entire HippyVM team.</p>
